The FrontSite
=============

The FrontSide is a platform for creating FE applications which can run in the browser and on the server. 


How to build your own FrontSite
----------------------------

First, clone a copy of the main FrontSite git repo by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paapster/the_frontsite.git
```

Install the [grunt-cli](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli) package if you haven't before. These should be done as global installs:

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
